## BASIC THEORY OF BRUTE FORCE ALGORITHM IN JAVA ##
 
 A brute force algorithm is a straightforward and exhaustive approach to solving 
 
 a problem by considering all possible solutions and selecting the one that meets the desired criteria.
 
 While brute force algorithms are often simple to implement,
 
 they can be inefficient for large or complex problems due to their high time complexity.

 Brute force algorithms involve exhaustive search by considering all possibilities.


**1)In the discussed example, the algorithm checks each array element against the target value.**



**2)If a match is found, the index is returned; if not, -1 is returned.**


**3)The time complexity is O(n), increasing linearly with array size.**


**4)Not efficient for large arrays; more complex problems may require more efficient solutions.**



**5)Binary search for sorted arrays offers better time complexity.**



**6)Brute force is valuable for learning problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.**
