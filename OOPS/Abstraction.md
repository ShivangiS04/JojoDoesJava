## Abstraction

In simple terms, it is hiding the unnecessary details & showing only the essential parts/functionalities to the user.

## Data binding

Data binding is a process of binding the application UI and business logic. Any change made in the business logic will reflect directly to the application UI. 




**Abstraction is achieved in 2 ways :**

We can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.

1)Abstract class


2)Interfaces (Pure Abstraction)

### Abstract Class

The abstract method contains only method declaration but not implementation.

```
//abstract class
abstract class GFG{
  //abstract methods declaration
  abstract void add();
  abstract void mul();
  abstract void div();
}
```
