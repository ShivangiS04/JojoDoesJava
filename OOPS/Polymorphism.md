Polymorphism is the ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types). With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data. Precisely, Poly means ‘many’ and morphism means ‘forms’. 


**Types of Polymorphism** 


1. Compile Time Polymorphism (Static)



2. Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic) 

***Compile Time Polymorphism :***

The polymorphism which is implemented at the compile time is known as compile-time polymorphism. Example - Method Overloading
